a cryptography library for Rust that is tailored to support both standard (std) and customized (tstd) environments. With a comprehensive suite of cryptographic tools and algorithms, crypto enables secure and robust handling of encryption, hashing, and more.

## Features
Random Number Generator: Secure and efficient generation of random numbers and cryptographic keys.
* **AES-128**
* **secp256k1**
* **secp256r1**
* **SHA-1**
* **SHA-256**
* **sr25519**

## Unified Interface for std/tstd
crypto provides a unified interface that allows developers to write code compatible with both std and tstd environments, offering flexibility and cross-platform support.
